            <p> Hi! My name is Dakota and this is my second year at USC Aiken. My major is computer science <br>
                and I do not have a concentration. Besides going to school, I also work at an italian restaurant in <br>
                North Augusta called Antonio's. Some things I really enjoy are swimming, reading, and binge-watching shows.

                <li> Python Trivia Quiz project - In this project, my group created a trivia quiz in Python <br>
                    that allowed the user to choose a difficulty level and enter a, b, c, or d for the quiz <br>
                    questions. At the end, the score was printed. The skills required being able to read and write <br>
                    from an excel file into python that contained the quiz questions and answers. We also have to <br>
                    figure out how to loop the questions so that the score would be correctly calculated. <br>
                </li>
                <li> Visual Basic Contact Information project - In this project, my group created a contact list <br>
                    that showed allowed the user to choose a contact from a drop down box and display the contact <br>
                    information and a picture of the person. This program wrote in the information from an excel file <br>
                    and allowed the user to show, add, and delete contacts. The program also contained a button that <br>
                    would open the excel file and show the information there.
